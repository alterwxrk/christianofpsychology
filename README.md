My research for an idea of a healthy mind.
Since 2018, i had my first acid trip. at that time, im just a boy who was in chaos because of his unfortune childhood, and that mf 350ug kicked in every conner in my brain, made itself become unforgettable. 
Then, i found stoicism and analytical psychology.
I felt like they are which i live my whole life for, and they are.
The philosophy of stoicism teach me about how to use our mind in the right way, and protect it from the negative factors of external environment. it taught me about how Marcus Aurelius could keep his best consistencely in his whole career. and, it also taught me that, human's evolution is from a word "No" of some female monkeys.
At that time, i was college attendence of Greenwich, Marketing and Communication, there for i dealed with socialogical categories a lots, and it brought me to the analytical psychology, built by Carl G.Jung. In his work, Jung had highlightted the difference between personal unconcious and collective unconcious, he relatted it with acient religion to show the similar between cultures. and, im 23 currently, still to young to understand all of his word, but his idea of the "individual" term is like an existence of God.
These 4 years of mine are totally of chaos when i started to look for insight of me. i found unstatisfied desire, the darkest kind, a community which come from human's evolution and my personal experience, they are the source of which we call "Voice". And, i found God.
It wasn't a dream when there was a day, i smoked some blunt with my homies, i got strange chemical activation in my stomach which led me became a strange person, as their word, speaking some italian or french, idk, i never learn italian or french, all i know is never put pineaple on italian pizza (: and, all the mess start.
idk, just sometime i feel like there are some people who i dont know, know everything about me. maybe it's social media effect, or it is actually the communication of collective unconcious. only god knows (:
i purposed myself to dive in socialogy and idk why, i just want to.

So, i'm here to learn some database skills, it allows me to make my research more reliable, i can make some wealth for my company as well ;)
